## Study site: Lake Qaupat (QPT)

Lake Qaupat (QPT) is located in southern Baffin Island near the city of Iqaluit and Frobisher Bay (63.68&deg;N, 68.20&deg;W). The modern catchment vegetation is predominantly shrubs on land, including *Betula nana* and *Salix arctica*, and submerged aquatic mosses within the lake, such as *Calliergon richardsonii* (Hollister et al., 2022).

Sedimentary ancient DNA (*seda*DNA) evidence revealed that *Betula* sp. first colonized the catchment at 6.1 ka (Crump et al., 2019), following local Laurentide Ice Sheet deglaciation around ~9-8 ka (Miller, 1980). However, *seda*DNA can only be interpreted on a presence/absence basis, leaving questions about how the overall catchment vegetation community and biomass may have changed following *Betula* sp. colonization.

To address these questions, we use the Bayesian mixing model framework, MixSIAR (Stock et al., 2018), to quantitatively estimate the sources of plant waxes post-*Betula* sp. colonization to represent changes in vegetation/biomass.

## Data: Plant Wax *n*-alkanoic acids

We use plant wax *n*-alkanoic acid carbon chain-length distributions and $`\delta`$<sup>13</sup>C as tracers to model the contributions of different endmember priors. $`\delta`$<sup>13</sup>C values are used as the primary tracers and are weighted by the concentration of each carbon chain-length (Upadhayay et al., 2018).


## MixSIAR Workflow

1. **Generate model input files**
   
- **Mix**: Mixture files are the $`\delta`$<sup>13</sup>C values of specified *n*-alkanoic acid carbon chain-lengths in Lake QPT sediments. Downcore sediment measurements (Age $\geq$ -39 cal yr BP) are from this study, while other samples are from Hollister et al. (2022). These files are currently not produced by qpt_mixsiar_makeinputs.ipynb.
  
- **Source**: Means and standard deviations of user-defined vegetation endmembers in qpt_mixsiar_makeinputs.ipynb. Endmember statistics are created from individual samples in "qpt_plantwax_source.xlsx".
   - Note (02/11/2025): Published Lake QPT plant wax endmember data (Hollister et al., 2022; DOI: https://doi.org/10.1029/2022JG006903) currently available. Eastern Canadian Arctic plant wax data not yet published as part of Lindberg et al. (in prep): *Ecological and environmental controls on plant wax production and stable isotope fractionation in modern terrestrial Arctic vegetation*
   - Lake QPT plant wax endmember data from Hollister et al. (2022) is publically available on figshare: https://figshare.com/s/96c3bd6c11bae87c1e28?file=34381742

- **Discr**: Discrimination factors that account for potential alteration/fractionation between the endmember and mixture. These factors are not well-defined in sedimentary mixing studies (Menges et al., 2020), so the Python input script sets them all to "0".

2. **Run model experiments**

- MixSIAR experiements are run using qpt_mixsiar.R (Jupyter Notebook version in progress). The script is set to output two files upon model completion:
  
   1. **output_summary**: Lists model-calculated proportional (out of 1) contributions for each endmember as a mean, standard deviation, and percentile values.
  
   2. **diagnostics**: Determines if the model run reached sufficient convergence as dictated by the Gelman and Geweke diagnostic criteria described in each file.
   
3. Generate plots from output summaries (In progress)
