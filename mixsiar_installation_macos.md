# MixSAIR Installation Tutorial for MacOS

This tutorial will walk you through all of the steps needed to use MixSIAR (Stock et al., 2018); a framework for creating an running Bayesian mixing models. Instructions here are provided for MacOS, see mixsiar_installation_windows.md and mixsiar_installation_linux.md for installation instructions for Windows and Linux, respectively. These instructions assume R ($`\geq`$4.4.0) is already installed on your system. It is also recommended to have a graphical Integrated Development Environment (IDE), like RStudio, installed for running MixSIAR scripts line by line and to help debug. These instructions also provide you with everything you need to run LipidMM (Yang & Bowen, 2022); another, plant leaf wax-specific Bayesian mixing model framework that uses all of the same resources.

_Notes:_\
Requires MacOS 12+. Tested using MacOS 12.7.6 (Monterey)

## Install R packages (pre-JAGS-install)

## Install JAGS

## Install remaining R packages (post-JAGS-install)

## Post-Installation & References
You should now have everything you need to start using MixSIAR on your Linux system! Consider exploring the very helpful MixSIAR documentation and vignettes here (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MixSIAR/index.html) to start learning how to use the model.
