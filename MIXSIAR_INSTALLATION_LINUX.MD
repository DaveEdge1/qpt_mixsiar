This tutorial will walk you through all of the steps needed to use MixSIAR (Stock et al., 2018); a framework for creating an running Bayesian mixing models. Instructions here are provided for Linux-based operating systems, see MIXSIAR_INSTALLATION_WINDOWS.MD and MIXSIAR_INSTALLATION_MACOS.MD for installation instructions for Windows and MacOS, respectively. The full set of instructions can be applied to a completely new system with nothing else installed so feel free to skip ahead if you have already completed steps like installing R and RStudio.

Tested Linux distributions:
- Ubuntu (20.04, 22.04, 24.04) and distributions based on these Ubuntu versions (Linux Mint, Pop!_OS, TuxedoOS)
- Debian (12) and distributions based on these versions (MX Linux, Linux Mint Debian Edition)
- Fedora (40, 41)
- OpenSUSE (Tumbleweed)
- Arch Linux

## Install R
